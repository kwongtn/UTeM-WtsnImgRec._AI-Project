This is a simple command line based image recognition software using the IBM Watson service.
It is used as a project and proof-of-concept during my studies at UTeM (BaCompSc. in Artificial Intelligence) for the "Artificial Intelligence" Subject.

If the project website is still up, here it is:

^ Yes, we just did it for the sake of doing it :D

# How to use it
- Edit line 27 of "watson-vr.py" with your api key. API key can be obtained from the following website after registration and "creating an app":

```https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/watson/starter-kits/a0fc6bf5-8582-328f-9578-33dcc9377430/watson-visual-recognition-basic```

- Or, if you're running the compiled version, just run it in your terminal.

- When prompted, just paste in the path of your image file (not exceeding 10MB).
